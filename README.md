# ðŸ›³ Titanic Dataset â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Titanic dataset**.  
It covers data loading, inspection, cleaning, and visualization â€” with a focus on survival rates and distributions (Age, Fare), including breakdowns by **gender** and **passenger class**.

## ðŸ“„ Executive Summary
This notebook follows a **classic EDA workflow**:
1. **Data ingestion**
2. **Exploration**
3. **Cleaning**
4. **Visualization**

Cleaning actions:
- Removed columns with heavy missing values
- Filled missing values in specific columns (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Removed duplicate rows
- Converted data types where necessary

Visualizations include:
- Overall survival rate
- Survival rate by gender and passenger class
- Age and fare distributions
- Bonus: survival rate by class **and** gender

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives & Key Questions
The analysis is designed to answer:
- What is the **overall survival rate**?
- How does survival vary by **gender**?
- How does survival vary by **passenger class**?
- How are **age** and **fare** distributed, and how might they relate to survival?
- How do **class** and **gender** interact with survival?

---

## ðŸ›  Data Preparation
### Cleaning Steps
- **Remove**: columns with high missing values
- **Fill**: missing values for `Age` and `Embarked`
- **Drop**: duplicate rows
- **Convert**: data types as needed

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Measures & KPIs
- **Overall Survival Rate**
- **Survival Rate by Gender**
- **Survival Rate by Passenger Class**
- **Age & Fare Distributions**
- **Survival Rate by Class & Gender** 

---

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Recommendations
From the visualizations:
- Clear survival differences across **gender** and **class**
- Age and fare show notable spread that may relate to survival likelihood

---

## âš  Limitations
- **Exploratory only** â€” no predictive models or hypothesis tests
- Dropping columns with many missing values reduces dimensionality
- Imputation methods (for Age & Embarked) are not compared with alternatives

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Use cleaned dataset for **classification models** or **statistical tests**
- Perform **feature engineering** and evaluate alternative imputation methods
- Consider deeper interaction effects between features
